Another day in free writing zone. I was ready for it this time, so it's less of a shock.

It's still weird to be so close to my thoughts. Thoughts are so strange...

Like how they are actually matter (scientifically). And how much they matter... hmm!

A little bird told me, "thoughts become things!"

So be careful with what you think, because those thoughts could materialize into some real, tangible things. Does that mean to think positively? I'm not sure. If you want something positive in your life, then maybe!
