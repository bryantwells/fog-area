text: Ive seen things you people wouldn’t believe. BMW’s on fire off the outskirts of Gaenova. I watched Fasicarts glitter in the dark near the Shanghai Gates. I’ve been to Warszawa, Moscow, Paradiso and back... frontiers! I’ve stood on the back deck of a 757 bound for The Floating World with sweat in my eyes watching Negative Fires on the shoulders of the Atlantic. I’ve felt wind in my hair, rid- ing test boats near Castles off the Wein River and watched re- lationships burn like a match and spread into the Blackouts. I’ve seen it...felt it and Ive shown these things to children. Ive drawn drunken maps of them all and traded them for a bowl of village Borshch in a sober Moscow. The skyline looked like the Golden Saucer. Splintering underground Labyrinths in Dongdaemun Plaza with Yves Tumor. Children Shreiking in sync with White Maetal in Itaewon. I toasted Saki with Foodman in Shibuya at WWW Lounge and split my mind apart through a Vir- tuix Omni in Akihabara Electric Town and slept it off with Ely- sia Crampton in some gutted boheme in Berlin. I traded a shirt off my back in a burning LA, palm trees on fire on the 4th of July as the sky fell into a blood black nothingness. Gotham Lullabies. I saw cop cars flip onto flayed monsters in the streets of Richmond and listened as the Failed Sons and Daugh- ters of Fantasia recount adventures in The Floating Worlds. All of these moments, will live forever like fire over water.
