This past summer and current fall, I've been thinking a lot about my teaching philosophy. That is, if I have one. And if I do, what it is... especially now.

My thoughts were spurred into action by reading <i>Teaching as a Subversive Activity</i> (1971) by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner. The book's main thesis is that the most meaningful learning comes from one's own questioning. Learning is a lifelong experience and takes time, happening in formal and informal contexts. The most meaningful syllabus is one in which the students design themselves. Often, then, the job of the teacher becomes one of constructing a learning environment rather than providing the content of the learnings.

Following the "primitive hypertext" idea from Octavia Butler, I then started reading Carl Rogers' <i>On Becoming A Person: A therapist's view of psychotherapy</i>, which is mentioned many times in the other book. This book is more generally about working with people to helping them become their true selves. It can have applications in everyday life, like if you have a client. Or if you're working with students...

I've also been exploring the Reggio Emilia approach, the story of Maria Montessori and her method, among others. I've collected some of my findings in this (link: https://www.are.na/laurel-schwulst/teaching-is-creating-learning-environments text: channel on Are.na target:_blank).
