text: if the world only exists through its perceptions by a subject (ie, objects as such dont properly exist) then it follows (via many twists and turns) that cause and effect are not as tightly linked as we have been brought along to think. and further, if the world is only built from discrete perceptions ("sense reports‚Äù) and objects dont as such exist, then time (like things) can only exist as it is perceived. time is then, according to hume, actually PRODUCED by changes in our perceptions. so time is manufactured by our perceptions of how things change.
