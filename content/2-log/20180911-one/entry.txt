Text: During the first free writing, I felt weird, like I was forced to write. I didn't like the music Laurel was playing. It was kind of haunting and dystopian. But then it grew on me. Life is weird like that. Then I started writing about my day. I realized I had a pretty good day up until that moment, so I was thankful. Lots of little details like my coffee being extra energizing, the wind being extra comfortable, and so on.
